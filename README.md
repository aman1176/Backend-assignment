# Backend-assignment
We have two problems a and b and its solution is in a.cpp and b.cpp respectively.

problem a is little tricky.Its an extension of well known dijkstra with priority queue.Also care need to be taken when we reach some univere to know about how many time we need to hide ourself from getting caught in effiecient way(otherwise constraints would give tle).

Problem b:For a node a,we just have to find other node b which is hotspot and largest distance from node a.If it lies within range of x ,its our answer.
